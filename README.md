A simple CLI to solve the Spacecraft Problem, made with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Let's build a rocket together!

## The Problem

Say, the Canadian Space Agency is building an unmanned spacecraft thatâ€™ll go to the moon.

![To the moon](https://i.imgur.com/15vvnfN.png)

Hereâ€™s some more info about the project.

* The shipâ€™s starting coordinates are `(0, 0)`, which is on Earth.
* The shipâ€™s final destination is `(0, 250)`, which is on the moon.
* The ship will be controlled over a CLI using a standard keyboard as follows:

* The ship starts at `(0, 0)` at 0 speed, i.e. at complete rest.
The ship only moves when a valid key is pressed.
* Pressing `W` increases the shipâ€™s speed and then moves it forward by speed units.
  * The shipâ€™s maximum speed is 5.
* Pressing `S` decreases the shipâ€™s speed and then moves it forward by speed units.
  * The shipâ€™s minimum speed is 0.
  * After launch, the ship cannot go below speed 1, i.e. it always moves forward until it reaches the moon.

* Pressing `A` and `D` move the ship left and right by one unit respectively.
* The ship also moves forward by speed units.

## Problem

Write a CLI program in your preferred language to simulate the above spacecraft. Display output as follows:

* Begin with `(0, 0) ready for launch`.
* After every movement, display the updated position.
* If the ship goes more than 5 points to the left/right, display `wrong trajectory`.
* If the ship tries to decrease the speed below 1, display `minimum speed`.
* If the ship tries to increase the speed over 5, display `maximum speed`.
* When the ship reaches `(0, 250)` display `on the moon`.
* If the ship goes beyond 250 on the y-axis, display `contact lost`.

## Demo

![Demo Example](./images/demo.gif)

## Sample output

```none
(0, 0) # Begin with original position.
(0, 1) # W increases the speed to 1 and moves forward.
(0, 3) # W increases the speed to 2 and moves forward.
(-1, 5) # A moves the ship left and forward.
(0, 7) # D moves the ship right and forward.
(0, 8) # S decreases the speed to 1 and moves forward.
...
(0, 250) on the moon # Ship reaches the moon
```

## Install Globally


```sh
npm i -g spacecraft-app-cli
```

or

You can run directly with `npx`

```sh
npx spacecraft-app-cli
```

## Getting started - Local Development

### Requirements

* NodeJS 12.22.1
* Npm 6.14.12

See [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs)

1. Clone to your local computer using `git`.
2. Make sure you have Node installed; see instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Usage

```sh
# starts ðŸš€ on coordinates (0,0) - Earth
yarn start

# Use W, A, S, or D  to starting control ðŸš€ .
```

### Build the CLI bundle

```sh
yarn build
```
